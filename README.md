# KL05Z Thermometer_Project" 
This project involves developing one-wire library for the DS18B20 temperature sensor on the KL05Z32 microcontroller. The main goal was to enable temperature reading in both Celsius and Kelvin, as well as to implement an alarm system for high and low temperatures, configurable via buttons.
